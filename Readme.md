# FROST CODE 2023 - SWAP SQUARE

## About
Swap Square, developed by Binary Bros Brigade, addresses the challenge of facilitating seamless secondhand transactions among students within an institution.

### Problem Statement
- Limited accessibility hinders students selling used items among campus peers.
- Connectivity gaps between seniors and juniors impede secondhand transactions.
- External purchases pose reliability issues, impacting confidence in product quality and authenticity.

### Solution
Swap Square fosters a platform where students can buy and sell used products among themselves, enhancing accessibility, improving connectivity, and ensuring reliability by allowing only registered institute email IDs.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Create User Routes and Frontend
- Implemented Login/Signup routes with Google Auth API.
- Developed a responsive UI for login/signup page. (Completed on 6/12/2023)

### Step 2: Integrating Routes and Frontend
- Integration of routes with the frontend. (Estimated Completion Date: 8/12/2023)

### Step 3: Create Item Routes and Frontend
- Creation of CRUD item routes with picture uploads and pricing.
- Designing a responsive UI for the marketplace. (Estimated Completion Date: 9/12/2023)

### Step 4: Link Routes with User Routes
- Integration of item routes with user routes. (Estimated Completion Date: 9/12/2023)

### Step 5: Integration and Relationship Setup
- Establishing a one-to-many relationship between users and products.

### Step 6: Deployment
- Hosting the website using services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages. (Estimated Completion: 12/12/2023)

## Progress So Far 
- We have completed the backend of User Routes along with responsive view of  the frontend of Login/SignUp page.
- Google Auth API integration is in testing phase and the changes are yet to be pushed to the remote repository.


## Future Scopes
- Potential integration with Google Maps API to enhance features.
- Improving reliability by verifying student IDs (ID Card and Roll Number) before transactions.

*Accessibility in this context refers to the ease and availability of channels or platforms facilitating student-to-student secondhand transactions within the campus community.*
